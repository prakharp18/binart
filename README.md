## Overview

Binart transforms your browser into a powerful digital canvas with a unique focus on **Binary Export (RLE)** and **complete privacy**. Your drawings never leave your device - everything runs locally in your browser with zero data collection or cloud dependencies.

The standout feature is the **RLE (Run-Length Encoding) export system** that compresses your artwork into tiny files while maintaining perfect fidelity. Combined with our privacy-first approach, this makes Binart ideal for sensitive design work, personal sketches, and collaborative projects where data ownership matters.

## ‚ú® Core Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Privacy-First** | Complete offline functionality - no data ever leaves your browser, no tracking, no servers |
| **Drawing Tools** | Pen, brush with charcoal texture, and marker with neon glow effects |
| **Shape Library** | Rectangles, circles, triangles, stars, and diamonds |
| **Text Integration** | Add and customize text with adjustable fonts and colors |
| **Binary Export (RLE)** | Revolutionary compression system that saves entire drawings as tiny text files - the core innovation of Binart |

### üî• Binary Export (RLE) - The Game Changer

The **Run-Length Encoding (RLE) export** is what makes Binart special. Instead of just saving static images, it captures:

- Every stroke with perfect precision
- All drawing tool settings and styles  
- Text elements with fonts and positioning
- Shape data with exact dimensions
- Animation states and wiggle effects

A complex drawing that would be several MB as a PNG becomes just a few KB as an RLE file, while remaining fully editable when reimported. This makes Binart perfect for iterative design work and collaborative projects.
